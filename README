## Hamming Distance between two integers
The Hamming Distance between two integers is defined as the number of differing bits at the same position when comparing the binary representations of the integers. For example, the Hamming Distance between `1011101` and `1001001` is 2.

In the assignment, I implement the program to calculate the Hamming Distance between the two given 64-bit unsigned integers. 

### Motivation
I use a while loop to iterate through two integers, get their least significant bits (LSB), and then compare them to each other. Using the leading-zero counting function makes it possible to obtain the number of bits of the input integers, thus reducing the number of comparisons in the loop.
